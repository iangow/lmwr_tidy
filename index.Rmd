This is a fan-created companion to ["Learning Microeconometrics with R"](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0367255383).

The code here departs from the book in a few respects:

1. More use of the Tidyverse for data manipulation.
2. More use of functions
3. Use of the `lmwr` package for data (see below for details).

The code for this book is available on GitHub [here](https://github.com/iangow/lmwr_tidy).

# Prerequisites {-}

The **lmwr** package provides data and can be installed from Github:

```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("iangow/lmwr")
```
